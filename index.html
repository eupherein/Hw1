					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<img id="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/oP4ZEkX.jpg" height="250px" width="150px">

					<p>In high school I was dead set on not going to college, and shortly after deciding that I dual enrolled at an automotive
						tech class until I realized that wasn't the pinacle of my career, and left that field shortly after starting at a drift
						car shop.</p>
					<p>Shortly after having decided to start my AA toward Computer Science, I looked into the coding bootcamp offered at UCF
						and never went to fill out my classes after changing my mind yet again to become a developer in three months, and use
						those skills gain experience in the field while working towards my AA.
					</p>
					<p>I also buy a lot of graphics cards for mining :^)
